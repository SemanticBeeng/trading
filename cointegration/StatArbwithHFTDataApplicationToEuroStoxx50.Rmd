## Data Summary

## Paper Summary

### Introduction

* The extent to which a pair of stocks in EuroStoxx 50 is cointegrated at daily frequencies is a good indicator for profitability at higher frequencies if the pair is selected by a combination of criteria involving cointegration.

* using high-frequency data leads to higher potentially achievable information ratio compared to the use of daily closing prices

Issue: implies causality but only shows "association".

### Main techniques

1. Group stocks in the Eurostoxx 50 index in industry groups
Q: How to reproduce the groups?

2. Within each industry group create pairs of stocks
Q: Does it matter how pairs are made or create all the combinations?

3. For each pair calculate time adaptive/varying betas using Kalman filters

Note: OLS (ordinary least squares) and DESP (double exponential smoothing prediction) are dropped in favor of Kalman filters.

4. Trade the following strategy : 
- enter both positions when spread > 2 standard deviations
- exit both positions when spread returned < 0.5 standard deviations of long term mean

*Key finding*
Results are not attractive

5. Calculate the information ratio of the series (what frequency?)

6. Obtain the t-stat of the ADF test of the series sample at daily interval 

7. Build a diversified portfolio of 5 pairs with the best indicator value

*Key finding*
An indicator made from a combination of the two above (?) produces information ratios of

- over 3 for high frequencies 
- 1.3 for daily frequency

Compares favorably with the performance of Eurostoxx 50 index and the index of Market Neutral Hedge Funds.

8. Calculate the cointegration of pairs using Engle and Granger (chosen vs. the Johansen test due to simplicity and lower variance)

...?

9. Test for a positive correlation between the t-stat of the ADF test on the OLS residuals and the out of sample "information ratio" (uses bootstrap); test is a PCA on a normalized matrix of t-stats from the ADF test for 176 pairs x (5, 10, 20, 30, 60) frequencies

*Key finding*
In sample t-stat at 5min and 10 min frequencies have certain predictive power for the out of sample information ratio.

The first principal component explains 97% of the variation in the data.

10. Use the 2 above indicators to select a subset of 5 pairs


### Issues

"For daily data, the in-sample period is much longer than the out-of-sample period." 
Too little out of sample data.

"For high-frequency data the in- and out-of-sample periods have the same lengths"
Data is split just in two sets. Needs more sophisticated cross validation, k-fold validation, etc.
